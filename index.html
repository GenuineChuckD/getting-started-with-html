<h1> Important Concepts</h1>
<h2><b>How the Web Works</b></h2>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate 
with each other.  When a person goes to a web page like 
www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> 
to a <em>server</em>. If a server finds the appropriate 
HTML document and it back to the user's computer where a
<em>web browser</em>interprets the page and displays it on 
the user's computer.</p>
<p>
  <br><b> The Basics of the Web </b></br>
<ul><em>The Web</em></ul> 
A wide variety of files can be found on the web.  The primary file type found on the web is HTML.
Other file types found on the web are plain text, Images, videos, and music files. You can link to
whatever file type you like--that's what makes the web great! It's versitile and displays a wide variety of document and multimedia file types.

The internet is the world's largest comuter network. Taking a global perspective of the web, we look at you 
(the user), your computer, the internet, and servers. Your computer runs a program called a web browser (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Explorer, Safari, etc.) that makes requests via the internet to servers to display files found on the web.  Servers are computers that host the files that make up the web. They are optimized to utilize a protocol called HTTP to access the requested information that allows the server to handle a much larger volume of information and hosting data requests than a simple PC. Put simply, you use your computer to commmunicate with these servers. 
<ul><em>HTML</em></ul>
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  It is made up of text content, what the text looks like, and references to other documents. HTML works by using a special type of programming language called tags.  Tags tell the computer what to do when referencing and displaying a requested web page or document made by your browser. It is the main document type of the web. 

Tags typically have an open and a closing tag that surrounds text or information that the computer needs to display. If you create an openning tag that specifies a particular format for a specified text, you must using a closing tag around the element to indicate that the need for the format has ended on that particular line of text. If a closing tag is not used, then the browser will continue to interpret all of the text following it in the specified format.    HTML can change the format, look, order, and content of a web page. 

There are types of tags that do not require a closing tag.  These usually utilize urls and specific file links to display the information requested.  These tags are called Void tags.

There is a stylistic caveat when using tags.  Tags display the specified information <em>inline</em> with surrounding text or by <em>block</em>, setting the text or image aside from surrounding text. 
<ul><em>URLs</em></ul>
How you refer to documents on the web.  URLs are used in anchor references and image source tags.  URLs allow the user to connect from one page to another through links.  Linking documents together create a "web" that is the essential content of the internet.

URLs are frequently used in anchor tags and image source tags.

<ul><em>HTTP</em></ul>
The main protocol that unites the web and which the web runs. Servers respond to this protocol. 
<ul><em>Web Applications</em></ul>
What are Web Apps?  How do they fit into the big picture?
</p>
<p><b> Computers are Stupid</b>
Programmers often describe computers as "stupid."

When they say this, they mean that computers are only as intelligent as the programmers are that give them input. This comment is meant to address an important point about how computers interpret this input provided by the programmers.
